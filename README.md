## Setup

> [!WARNING]
> AR Foundation 5.x requires Unity's New Input System. You either need to have **Active Input Handling** set to **Input System Package (New)** or **Both**.

See <https://github.com/CandyCoded/ARFoundation-Components-Demo> for a working example of the following steps.

### Install Dependencies

1. Install the latest **ARKit XR Plugin**, **ARCore XR Plugin** and **AR Foundation** (preview) packages from the Package Manager.
2. Install both the **ARFoundation Components** and **CandyCoded** package (see above).

### Setup AR Foundation

1. Remove the **Main Camera** gameObject from the hierarchy (as the **XR Origin (Mobile AR)** contains its own camera).
1. Create a new **XR Origin (Mobile AR)** gameObject from the **Create Asset / XR** context menu.
1. Select the **XR Origin (Mobile AR)** gameObject and attach the **AR Raycast Manager** component.
1. Create a new **AR Session** gameObject from the **Create Asset / XR** context menu.
1. Create a new **AR Default Plane** gameObject from the **Create Asset / XR** context menu, drag it into the **Asset** panel creating a prefab and then remove it from the hierarchy.
1. Attach the **AR Plane Manager** component to the **XR Origin (Mobile AR)** gameObject and drag the **AR Default Plane** prefab from the **Assets** panel into the **Plane Prefab** property.
1. Change the **Detection Flags** to **Horizontal** (or whatever plane type you will target).

### Setup ARFoundation Components

1. Select the **AR Camera** in the **XR Origin (Mobile AR)** gameObject and change the **Light Estimation Mode** on the **AR Camera Manager** component to **AmbientIntensity**.
1. Select the **Directional Light** gameObject and attach the **AR Light Estimation** component.
1. Drag the **AR Camera** component into the **Camera Manager** property of the **AR Light Estimation** component.
1. Attach the **AR Plane Events** and **AR Place Object On Plane** components to the **XR Origin (Mobile AR)** gameObject.
1. Create a new **Cube** and set the scale to `Vector3(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f)`, drag it into the **Asset** panel creating a prefab and then remove it from the hierarchy.
1. Drag the **Cube** into the **Object to Place** property of the **AR Place Object On Plane** component and enable the option **Place Multiple**.
1. Create a new event in the **Plane Touched with Touch Position** event section of the **AR Plane Events** component.
1. Drag the **XR Origin (Mobile AR)** gameObject into the object field of the event.
1. Select the **ARPlaceObjectOnPlane** > **PlaceObjectOnPlane** dynamic method from the dropdown.

### Setup iOS build

1. Check that the scene is in the **Build Settings** window.
1. Change the build platform in the **Build Settings** window to **iOS**.
